REST stands for Representational State Transfer. 
A diagram shows a common paradigm for information exchange between a client (software being run by a user) and a database (software to persist data storage).
1) Client, the user, interacts with the web-based client software.
2) The request and send a query to the database in a format the database can interpret and respond to. The server is, in essence, the interpreter between the client and the database. A client-run piece of software may be using JavaScript, while the database may represent its data in SQL. 
3) Application Server, has to process the incoming JavaScript and translate to an SQL-friendly format the database can respond to.
4,5,6) Server and Database communicate back and forth gathering and processing the data requested by the client software. Note that this process of communication between the server and database doesn't require multiple cycles. If, for instance, a user wants to log into Facebook, there might be a single relay between the server and database, returning and OK status with some user details. On the other hand, if a user requests 1000 users from a search query and the 1000 users' pictures, there may be a single exchange between server and database for user data, and separate exchange for the users' pictures. The complexity of the request and form of the data represented by the database are some factors playing into the number of cycles in this communication exchange.
7) The server formats the database-formatted data into a response the client software can interpret, and sends that response in 8.

Ultimately, with the data the client originally requested, it's new job of the client software to format and present the data to the user.
